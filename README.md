The broad use of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires extensive connectivity between smart IoT devices (IoDs) over a vast geographic region. due to a lack of  Wide-area communication among IoDs is not practical due to the radio range and scalability problems of standard wireless sensor networks.
Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology is one approach that is emerging as a way to deliver long-range communication with little power usage. However, because of the limited network lifetime of the direct data transmission method, it will no longer be practical. The literature has thus suggested multi-hop data routing algorithms for LPWANs. However, there are a number of difficulties with multi-hop data transmission, including increased data latency, an energy imbalance, inefficient bandwidth utilization, and limited data throughput.
To address these challenges,I had implemented Small-World Characteristics (SWC). The network having SWC (i.e., low average path length and high average clustering coefficient) by introducing long-range links using centrality methods to reduce the number of intermediate hops for data transmission and also i had used comparision method for introducing optimal long-range links between the selected IoDs.
